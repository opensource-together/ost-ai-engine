## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-08

### Highlights
- API hardening and operational reliability
- Cleaner structure and faster DX with uv package manager
- Documentation updates for strict configuration

### Changes (aggregated from 1.0.1 â†’ 1.0.6)
- Configuration & startup
  - Enforce strict configuration validation; remove silent defaults; fail-fast on invalid/missing env (1.0.1, 1.0.6)
  - Database connectivity check at startup with timeout (1.0.1)
- Health & observability
  - Health endpoint checks DB; returns 200/503 with timeout (1.0.2)
  - Add request logging (chi Logger), timing logs in handlers, and health failure logs (1.0.6)
- API behavior & responses
  - Standardized JSON helpers and unified error responses (1.0.3)
  - Input validation improvements (bad/missing parameters return proper 4xx) (1.0.3)
- Router & structure
  - Switch to go-chi with RequestID, RealIP, Recoverer, Timeout middlewares (1.0.4)
  - Modularize API into config/db/handlers/router and slim main (1.0.5)
- Tooling & build
  - Adopt uv with PEP 621 [project] metadata; remove poetry.lock, commit uv.lock (1.0.6)
- Docs
  - README and Go API docs updated to note strict env requirements and examples (1.0.6)

### Notes
- Backward-compatible API behavior; significantly improved operational characteristics and developer experience.

## [1.0.6] - 2025-09-08

### Changed
- Go API: Strict env (no defaults), improved logging, chi router, modular layout
- Build: Adopt uv (PEP 621 metadata); remove poetry.lock and commit uv.lock
- Docs: README and Go API docs updated to note env requirements

### Notes
- Backward-compatible API behavior; operational characteristics improved

## [1.0.5] - 2025-09-08

### Changed
- Go API: Refactor into modular files (config.go, db.go, handlers.go, router.go) and slim main()

### Notes
- Internal structural change only; no behavior change. Backward-compatible.

## [1.0.4] - 2025-09-08

### Added
- Go API: Switch to go-chi router with RequestID, RealIP, Recoverer, Timeout middlewares

### Notes
- Patch release focused on routing and middleware improvements. Backward-compatible.

## [1.0.3] - 2025-09-08

### Changed
- Go API: Standardized JSON response helpers (writeJSON, writeError) and refactored handlers

### Notes
- Patch release focused on API response consistency. Backward-compatible.

## [1.0.2] - 2025-09-08

### Added
- Go API: Health endpoint now checks database connectivity with 500ms timeout and returns 200/503 accordingly

### Changed
- Improved operational readiness by surfacing DB issues via /health

### Notes
- Patch release focusing on operational health reporting. Backward-compatible.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-08

### Changed
- Go API: Enforce strict configuration validation (no silent defaults in non-dev)
- Go API: Fail-fast startup with database PingContext timeout

### Removed
- Dropped non-essential dbt integration test (`tests/integration/test_dbt_models.py`) to avoid flaky CI deps

### Fixed
- Minor robustness improvements in API startup and configuration parsing

### Notes
- This is a backward-compatible patch release focusing on reliability of the Go API service.
